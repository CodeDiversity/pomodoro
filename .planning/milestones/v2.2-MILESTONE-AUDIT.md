## Requirements Coverage

### 3-Source Cross-Reference

| Requirement | VERIFICATION.md | REQUIREMENTS.md | Status |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| STRK-01 | SATISFIED | [x] checked | satisfied |

| IMPT-04 | SATISFIED | [ ] unchecked | satisfied (update checkbox) |
| IMPT-05 | SATISFIED | [ ] unchecked | satisfied (update checkbox) |

**Note:** EXPT and IMPT requirements are satisfied but checkboxes in REQUIREMENTS.md were not updated after phase verification. This is a documentation issue, not a requirement gap.

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Must-Haves | Details |
|-------|--------|------------|---------|
| 13: Streak Tracking | passed | 7/7 | All streak functionality verified |
| 14: Data Export/Import | passed | 10/10 | Export and import both working |
| 15: Integration & Polish | passed | 7/7 | Styling and edge cases addressed |

## Integration Findings

### Cross-Phase Wiring: 83% (5/6 connections)

**Working Flows:**
1. Session completion → streak recalculation ✓
2. CSV export from History ✓
3. Stats view → streak display ✓

**Partial Flows (UX enhancements, not blockers):**
4. CSV import → streak recalculation (INT-01)
   - Sessions save to IndexedDB
   - Streak recalculates on NEXT session completion
   - Not a requirement violation

5. Session deletion → streak update (INT-02)
   - Sessions removed from History view
   - Streak recalculates on NEXT session completion
   - Not a requirement violation

---

## Tech Debt

| Phase | Item | Severity | Recommendation |
|-------|------|----------|----------------|
| 14→13 | CSV import doesn't trigger streak recalc | Minor | Add recalculateStreak() call after import |
| 14→13 | Session deletion doesn't trigger streak recalc | Minor | Add recalculateStreak() call after deletion |

These are optional UX improvements. Not required for milestone completion.

---

## Recommendation

**Status: PASSED**

All 17 requirements satisfied. All 3 phases verified. Integration gaps are UX enhancements, not blockers.

**To address checkbox discrepancy:** Update REQUIREMENTS.md to check off EXPT-01 through IMPT-05 before archiving.
