### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| None | - | - | - | - |

No anti-patterns found. No TODO/FIXME/PLACEHOLDER comments, no placeholder implementations.

### Human Verification Required

None required. All verification can be performed programmatically:
- Modern styling patterns (shadows, transitions, focus-visible) verified via code inspection
- Key links (imports) verified via grep
- All artifacts verified for existence and substantive implementation

### Gaps Summary

No gaps found. All must-haves verified:
- All 15 observable truths achieved
- All 14 required artifacts exist and are substantive
- All 9 key links wired to theme.ts
- No anti-patterns detected
