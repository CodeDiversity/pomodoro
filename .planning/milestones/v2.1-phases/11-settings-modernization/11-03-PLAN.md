<objective>
Integrate SoundSettings into Settings page with design system improvements

Purpose: Update the Settings component to include the new SoundSettings section, ensuring it follows the app's design system (light mode, blue accents) and is rendered as a full-page view integrated into the main layout.

Output: Updated Settings.tsx

<task type="auto">
  <name>Integrate SoundSettings into Settings page</name>
  <files>src/components/Settings.tsx</files>
  <action>
In src/components/Settings.tsx:
1. Import SoundSettings from './settings/SoundSettings'
2. In the page view mode (viewMode === 'page'), add a new "Sound" section:
   - After the "Timer" section and before the "Data" section
   - Include a SectionTitle "Sound" with SoundSettings component below

Ensure the Settings page is already styled with light mode (white background, #1A1A1A titles, #666 subtitle text) and uses ${colors.primary} for interactive elements.

The existing Settings.tsx already has:
- PageContainer with max-width 600px, white background, 16px border-radius, box-shadow
- PageTitle with font-size 1.5rem, font-weight 600, color #1A1A1A
- SectionTitle with uppercase, letter-spacing, muted colors
- ToggleSwitch with ${colors.primary} for checked state

No major redesign needed - the existing page view mode already follows the design system.
