  - Changed alignment to left-aligned
  - Updated progress bar to fill container width

### TimerControls.tsx
- **Horizontal Layout:** Changed from vertical to horizontal row layout

- **Icons:** Increased size for secondary buttons (22px vs 20px)

### NotePanel.tsx

  - Title: "Active Session" (1.1rem, font-weight: 600)
  - Subtitle: "Configure your current focus task" (0.85rem, muted)
- **Task Input:** Added task icon (checkmark in circle) to left of input field
- **SESSION NOTES Label:** Added uppercase label above formatting toolbar
- **Full Height:** Panel now uses flex: 1 to fill available space
- **Textarea:** Updated to flex and fill remaining space with resize: none

### TagInput.tsx
- **TAGS Label:** Added uppercase section label above tags container
- **# Prefix:** Tags now display with # prefix (e.g., #work, #design)
